        Apple growers from Washington State have almost a million boxes of apples this year to India, which is 16 times more than last year.
        "This is a new day in trade relations between the United States and India," Senator Maria Cantwell told reporters in Seattle on Tuesday.
        She was joined by Prakash Gupta, the Consul General of the newly opened India Consulate in Seattle, along with apple growers from Central 
        Washington and labour and port officials.
        "Apples are the pride of the Washington agricultural economy. They are known worldwide. Today is a celebration because, for five years 
        now, we have not seen the volume of apples leaving these docks and travelling to India," said Cantwell, who was flanked by apple growers.
