        Banana, fruit of the genus Musa, of the family Musaceae, one of 
        the most important fruit crops of the world. The banana is grown
        in the tropics, and, though it is most widely consumed in those 
        regions, it is valued worldwide for its flavour, nutritional value,
        and availability throughout the year. Cavendish, or dessert, 
        bananas are most commonly eaten fresh, though they may be fried 
        or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings. They may also be used 
        to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads. Cooking varieties, or 
        plantains, are starchy rather than sweet
