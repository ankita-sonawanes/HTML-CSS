    Kiwi, (Actinidia deliciosa), woody vine and edible fruit of the 
    family Actinidiaceae. The plant is native to mainland China and Taiwan 
    and is also grown commercially in New Zealand and California. The fruit
     has a slightly acid taste and can be eaten raw or cooked. The juice is
      sometimes used as a meat tenderizer. Raw kiwis are high in vitamins C 
      and K.
